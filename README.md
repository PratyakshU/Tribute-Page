          <h3 id="headline">Here's a life and work of Aryabhata:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>476 CE</strong> - Pataliputra, India. </li>
            <li>
              <strong></strong> Aryabhata created a system of phonemic number notation in which numbers were represented by consonant-vowel monosyllables.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Place value system and zero</strong> -The place-value system, first seen in the 3rd-century Bakhshali manuscript, was clearly in place in his work. While he did not use a symbol for zero, the French mathematician Georges Ifrah argues that knowledge of zero was implicit in Aryabhata's place-value system as a place holder for the powers of ten with null coefficients.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Approximation of π</strong> -Aryabhata worked on the approximation for pi (π), and may have come to the conclusion that π is irrational. In the second part of the Aryabhatiyam (gaṇitapāda 10).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trigonometry</strong> - Aryabhata discussed the concept of sine in his work by the name of ardha-jya, which literally means "half-chord". For simplicity, people started calling it jya.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Algebra</strong> - In Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata provided elegant results for the summation of series of squares and cubes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Motions of the solar system</strong> - Aryabhata correctly insisted that the earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the earth, contrary to the then-prevailing view, that the sky rotated. This is indicated in the first chapter of the Aryabhatiya, where he gives the number of rotations of the earth in a yuga, and made more explicit in his gola chapter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Eclipses</strong> - Solar and lunar eclipses were scientifically explained by Aryabhata. He states that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight. Instead of the prevailing cosmogony in which eclipses were caused by Rahu and Ketu.
            </li>
        
            <li><strong>550 CE</strong> - Araybhata Died.</li>
          </ul>
